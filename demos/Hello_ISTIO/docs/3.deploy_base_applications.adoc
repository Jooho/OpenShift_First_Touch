Arcitecture looks following.

This bash script(2.deploy_base_applications.sh) will deploy 6 pods and at first only v1 chat client is accessible even though there are 3 clients. Redis is for storing messages and Auth application to check authorization but it is a fake app so it is always returning 'OK' unless we don't enable longtask and misbehave. Lastly, there is external resource from common.redhat.com as a CDN server but it does not work now because all egress traffics are blocked by istio.


*Script*

```
$ ./2.deploy_base_application.sh
```
